SERVER SIDE TEMPLATING
vs
SINGLE PAGE APPS

in server side, user visits page, http request to server, server generates html document, user clicks a link, http request to server, server generates doc, etc

in single page, user visits page, http request to server, server generates html document,react/angular boots up and shows the page, user clicks a link, react angular shows new content

DIFFERENCE IS IN THE TOTALITY - single page only loads changes!
this sounds like an advantage.

templates vs. layouts
pretty standard. layouts are full page descriptors, templates are anything that follows a form factor, including templates and modules and what have you.

basic ecto syntax for the new migration
  def change do
    create table(:topics) do
      add :title, :string
  end

  creates a table named topics with a field named title containing a string data type
  where the hell are the constraints?
huh, didn't create the table...

  need a new url : add a new route in the router field
  new routes must map to a method in controller : add a new method to handle the request
  need to show a form to the user : make a new template containing the form
  need to translate data in the form to something that can be saved in database : create a topic model that can translate raw data from the form into sql
  the controller and view that we have are related to page but we need to relate to topic : make a new controller and view to handle everything related to topics
